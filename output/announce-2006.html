<h4 id="a20061107">07 Nov 2006 - Struts v2.0.1 BETA Release</h4>

<p>
  The Apache Struts project is pleased to announce the availability of
  the <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts201">
  Struts 2.0.1 BETA release</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework, well suited for
  enterprise-ready Java web applications.
  The framework is designed to streamline the full development cycle,
  from building, to deploying, to maintaining applications over time.
</p>

<p>
  Apache Struts 2 was originally known as WebWork 2.
  After working independently for several years,
  the WebWork and Struts communities joined forces to create Struts<sup>2</sup>.
  This new version of Struts is simpler to use and closer to how
  Struts was always meant to be.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Build!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy startup</strong> - A Maven archetype, template application, and bootstrap
        tutorial help jumpstart new projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Design</strong> - All framework classes are based on interfaces.
        Core interfaces are HTTP independent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Results</strong> - Unlike ActionForwards, Struts<sup>2</sup> Results can
        actually help prepare the response.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Tags</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> tags don't just output data, but provide
        stylesheet-driven markup, so that we can create consistent pages with less code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stateful Checkboxes</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> checkboxes do not require special
        handling for false values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy cancel handling</strong> - The Struts<sup>2</sup> Cancel button can go directly to
        a different action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>POJO forms</strong> - No more ActionForms! We can use any JavaBean we like or
        put properties directly on our Action classes. No need to use all String properties!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>POJO Actions</strong> - Any class can be used as an Action class. Even the
        interface is optional!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy Spring integration</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> Actions are Spring-aware. Just
        add Spring beans!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>First-class AJAX support</strong> - The AJAX theme gives interactive
        applications a boost.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>Deploy!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>QuickStart</strong> - Configuration files are reloadable so many changes
        can be made on the fly without restarting a web container.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy plugins</strong> - Framework extensions can be added by dropping in a JAR.
        No manual configuration required! Bundled plugins add support for JavaServer Faces,
        JasperReports, JFreeChart, Tiles, and more ...
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy portlets</strong> - Automatic portlet support allows portal and servlet
        deployments with no code changes.
      </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Maintain!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy-to-test Actions</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> Actions are HTTP independent and
        can be tested without resorting to mock objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Intelligent Defaults</strong> - Most framework configuration elements have a default
        value that we can set and forget.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy-to-customize controller</strong> - Struts 1 lets us customize the request
        processor per module, Struts<sup>2</sup> lets us customize the request handling
        per action, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy-to-tweak tags</strong> - Struts<sup>2</sup> tag markup can be altered by changing
        an underlying stylesheet. Individual tag markup can be changed by
        editing a FreeMarker template. No need to grok the taglib API!
        <em>JSP, FreeMarker, and Velocity tags are fully supported.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Integrating Debugging</strong> - Built-in debugging tools supporting profiling,
        problem reports, and interactive object model queries.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a20060818.1">18 Aug 2006 - Struts v1.3.5 Beta</h4>

<p>The Apache Struts team is pleased to announce the release of Struts 1.3.5 Beta.</p>

<p>Struts 1.3.5 is available in a full distribution, or as separate library, source, example and
  documentation distributions.</p>

<p><a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts135">
  http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts135</a></p>

<p>It is also available in the central Maven repository under Group ID
  "org.apache.struts".</p>

<p>Major changes since Struts 1.2 include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Composable Request Processor</li>
  <li>Arbitrary configuration properties</li>
  <li>Opt-In Cancel Handling</li>
  <li>Enhanced Global Exception Handlers</li>
  <li>Extends attribute</li>
  <li>"isCommitted" Exception Handling</li>
  <li>Postback Actions</li>
  <li>Wildcard ActionConfig properties</li>
</ul>

<p>Composable Request Processor: For Struts 1.3, we turned the request processor methods into Commands that
  are part of a flexible Chain of Commands.</p>

<p>Arbitrary configuration properties: Most every Struts configuration element now accepts a map of
  key/value pairs. Arbitrary configuration properties let us externalize more of our configurations,
  encouraging reuse.</p>

<p>Opt-In Cancel Handling: In Struts 1.3, the Cancel token is only honored if the new property "cancellable"
  is set for the Action Mapping. If the Cancel token is present, but cancellable is not set, then an
  InvalidCancelException is thrown. The InvalidCancelExeption may be caught by a Declarative Exception
  Handler, like any other Exception.</p>

<p>Enhanced Global Exception Handlers: We now support use of global exception handlers in cases when no
  ActionConfig has yet been identified, as in with "preprocessing" commands in a custom request processing
  chain.</p>

<p>Extends attribute: In the Struts configuration file, we can now use the extends attribute to adopt
  default settings from another element, as we already can in the Tiles configuration files.</p>

<p>"isCommitted" Exception Handling: When using Tiles, sometimes the response is already committed when an
  exception occurs. Now, the ExceptionHandler tests response.isCommitted, and, if true, includes the
  configured view path, rather than forwarding to it.</p>

<p>Postback Forms: The action attribute of the Form taglib is now optional. If omitted, the original URI of
  the original request is used.</p>

<p>Wildcard ActionConfig properties: Wildcards can now be used in the properties of an ActionConfig.</p>

<p>The 1.3.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minumum requirement of the following specification
  versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java Servlet 2.3 and JavaServer Pages (JSP) 1.2</li>
  <li>Java 2 Standard Platform Edition (J2SE) 1.4</li>
</ul>

<p>The release notes are available online at:</p>

<h4 id="a20060628.1">28 Jun 2006 - Shale to Become Top-Level
  ASF Project</h4>
<p>
  On behalf of the ASF Board and Struts PMC, we are pleased to
  announce that Shale has been accepted as a top-level project of
  the Apache Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  As a top-level project, Shale will have its own website, mailing
  lists, repository space, and Project Management Committee. Shale
  will be an automomous ASF project, rather than a subproject of
  Apache Struts.
</p>
<p>
  The Shale framework for JavaServer Faces is nearing its first
  stable release. As a top-level project, it will be easier for
  Shale to attract new developers and expand its growing community.
</p>


<p>
  The initial set of PMC members and committers for Shale is
  Craig McClanahan, James Mitchell, Greg Reddin, Sean Schofield,
  Wendy Smoak, Gary VanMatre, Matthias Wessendorf.
</p>

<p>
  Apache Shale has strong ties to both the Struts and MyFaces
  projects. Most of the Shale PMC members are already involved
  in both projects and plan on continuing to remain involved in
  them, along with Shale.
</p>

<p>
  Apache Shale is a modern web application framework, intended for
  developers adopting JavaServer Faces as a core technology.
</p>

<p>
  Shale began as a proposal for Struts 2.0, but instead became a
  subproject, so as to provide a JSF alternative for Struts
  developers. Recent developments for Struts 2 now make it
  easier for Struts developers to access JSF components from within
  an "action-based" application.
</p>

<p>
  The initial Shale codebase was donated by Craig McClanahan, who
  also donated the original Struts codebase.
</p>

<p>
  [Note: To accomodate Shale, the original framework had been given
  the name "Action". Now that Shale has graduated, the "Action"
  label is being dropped, and Struts is just Struts again.]

<h4 id="a20050328">23 Mar 2006 - Struts Shale Framework 1.0.2 Alpha</h4>
<p>
  The Struts team is pleased to announce the release of Struts Shale 1.0.2 Alpha.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/releases.html">
      http://struts.apache.org/releases.html</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Struts Shale Framework is a set of loosely coupled services,
  fundamentally based on JavaServer Faces, which may be combined as
  needed to meet particular application requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Compared to version 1.0.0 (version 1.0.1 was retired due to packaging
  issues), this version includes a substantial number of bugfixes and
  enhancements -- details are in the Release Notes -- and the following
  major new features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Shale Remoting is a complete overhaul of the remoting support in
    1.0.0, providing support for application or component developers who
    need to implement the server side behavior for AJAX callbacks. It is
    packaged as a small (40k) JAR that has no dependencies on the rest of
    Shale.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tiger Extensions is an optional add-on layer for those running on
    Java SE 5 (code named "Tiger"). The extensions let you use Java
    annotations to declare managed beans or register JSF components,
    without needing entries in a faces-config.xml file.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new "blank" starter application to get you up and running with a
    new project quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new "mailreader" demo application that duplicates the
    functionality of the Struts 1.x version of this app, so you can
  </li>
  <li>
    A new "SQL Browser" demo application that illustrates use of the
    Tiger Extensions, as well as the ability to modify JSF component trees
    on the fly.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although this is considered an alpha release, various developer APIs
  should be considered at a more stable (in terms of assurances of
  backwards compatibility in future releases) point than might otherwise
  be expected. Please see the following web page for more details:
