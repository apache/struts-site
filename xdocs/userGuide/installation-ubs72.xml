<ul>
  <li>You need UBS version 7.2 to run war file applications. The UBS 7.2.2 evaluation
    is located <a href="http://www.bluestone.com/SaISAPI.dll/SaServletEngine.class/products/downloads.jsp">here</a>.
    If you're using version 7.2.1, you need to download the WAR file patch, located
    in the product enhancement section of Bluestone's website <a href="http://www.bluestone.com/SaISAPI.dll/SaServletEngine.class/products/wfe.jsp">here</a>
  </li>
  <li> After installation of the correct version and/or patch of UBS 7.2, you
    need to modify your apserver.txt file to point to the correct directory for
    your war file applications. Look for the section that says something similar
    to the following:<br />
    <pre>
  [SaServletEngine.class]
  session_affinity=1
  type=1
  program=/SaServletEngine.class
  file_path=f:\webapps
  host=localhost:20000
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>Use the directory specified by the "file_path" variable, or modify it to
    point to your own custom webapp directory. Copy the "struts-documention.war"
    and "struts-example.war" files into that webapp directory, and start the UBS
    (read documentation distributed with UBS for information on how to start it
    if necessary). Your webapps are now accessible from the following URL:
    <p class="center"> http://localhost/&lt;PLUGIN&gt;/SaServletEngine.class/struts-example/<br />
      http://localhost/&lt;PLUGIN&gt;/SaServletEngine.class/struts-documentation/
    </p>
  </li>

  <li> Note: "&lt;PLUGIN&gt;" represents the plugin you are using for your specific
    webserver. For Apache on Windows, it might be "cgi-bin/SaCGI.exe", for IIS
    on Windows, it might be "scripts/SaCGI.exe" or "scripts/ISAPI.dll". Consult
    the UBS documentation for more information. </li>
</ul>
