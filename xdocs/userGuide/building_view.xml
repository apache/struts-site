<section name="3. Building View Components">

<subsection name="3.1 Overview">

    <p>
    This chapter focuses on the task of building the <em>View</em> components
    for use with the Struts framework. 
    Many applications rely on JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology to create the 
    presentation layer. 
    The Struts distribution includes a comprehensive JSP tag library that 
    provides support for building internationalized applications, as well as 
    for interacting with input forms.
    Several other topics related to the View components are briefly discussed.
    </p>

<subsection name="3.2 Internationalized Messages">

    <p>
    A few years ago, application developers could count on having to support
    only residents of their own country, who are used to only one (or 
    sometimes two) languages, and one way to represent numeric quantities like 
    dates, numbers, and monetary values.  
    However, the explosion of application development based on web 
    technologies, as well as the deployment of such applications on the 
    Internet and other broadly accessible networks, have rendered national 
    boundaries invisible in many cases.  
    This has translated (if you will pardon the pun) into a need for 
    applications to support <em>internationalization</em> (often called "i18n" 
    because 18 is the number of letters in between the "i" and the "n") and 
    <em>localization</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Struts builds upon the standard classes available on the Java platform to
    build internationalized and localized applications. 
    The key concepts to become familiar with are:
    </p>

    <ul>
    
        <li>
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html">
        <strong>Locale</strong></a> - The fundamental Java class that supports 
        internationalization is <code>Locale</code>.  
        Each <code>Locale</code> represents a particular choice of country and 
        language (plus an optional language variant), and also a set of 
        formatting assumptions for things like numbers and dates.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">
        <strong>ResourceBundle</strong></a> - The <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code> 
        class provides the fundamental tools for supporting messages in 
        multiple languages.  
        See the Javadocs for the <code>ResourceBundle</code> class, and the 
        information on Internationalization in the documentation bundle for your 
        JDK release, for more information.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html">
        <strong>PropertyResourceBundle</strong></a> - One of the standard 
        implementations of <code>ResourceBundle</code> allows you to define 
        resources using  the same "name=value" syntax used to initialize 
        properties files.  
        This is very convenient for preparing resource bundles with messages 
        that are used in a web application, because these messages are 
        generally text oriented.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html">
        <strong>MessageFormat</strong></a> - The <code>java.text.MessageFormat</code> 
        class allows you to replace portions of a message string (in this 
        case, one retrieved from a resource bundle) with arguments specified 
        at run time.  
        This is useful in cases where you are creating a sentence, but the 
        words would appear in a different order in different languages.
        The placeholder string <code>{0}</code> in the message is replaced by
        the first runtime argument, <code>{1}</code> is replaced by the 
        second argument, and so on.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="../struts-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts/util/MessageResources.html">
        <strong>MessageResources</strong></a> - The Struts class 
        <code>org.apache.struts.util.MessageResources</code> lets you treat
        a set of resource bundles like a database, and allows you to request
        a particular message string for a particular Locale (normally one
        associated with the current user) instead of for the default Locale
        the server itself is running in.
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>
    Please note that the i18n support in a framework like Struts is limited to 
    the <strong>presentation</strong> of internationalized text and images to the user.
    Support for Locale specific <strong>input methods</strong> (used with languages
    such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean) is left up to the client device, 
    whichis usually a web browser.
    </p>

    <p>
    For an internationalized application, follow the steps described in
    the Internationalization document in the JDK documentation bundle for your
    platform to create a properties file containing the messages for each
    language.  
    An example will illustrate this further:
    </p>

    <p>
    Assume that your source code is created in package
    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage</code>, so it is stored in a directory
    (relative to your source directory) named
    <code>com/mycompany/mypackage</code>.  
    To create a resource bundle called
    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyApplication</code>, you would create the
    following files in the <code>com/mycompany/mypackage</code> directory:
    </p>

    <ul>

        <li>
        <strong>MyApplication.properties</strong> - Contains the messages in the default
        language for your server.  
        If your default language is English, you might have an entry like 
        this: <code>prompt.hello=Hello</code>
        </li>

        <li>
        <strong>MyApplication_xx.properties</strong> - Contains the same messages in the
        language whose ISO language code is "xx" (See the
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">
        ResourceBundle Javadoc</a> page for a link to the current list).  
        For a French version of the message shown above, you would have this 
        entry: <code>prompt.hello=Bonjour</code>
        You can have resource bundle files for as many languages as you need.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
    When you configure the controller servlet in the web application
    deployment descriptor, one of the things you will need to define in
    an initialization parameter is the base name of the resource bundle
    for the application.  
    In the case described above, it would be 
    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyApplication</code>.
    </p>

<source><![CDATA[
<servlet>
<servlet-name>action</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>
org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet
</servlet-class>
<init-param>
<param-name>application</param-name>
<param-value>
    com.mycompany.mypackage.MyResources
</param-value>
</init-param>
<!-- ... -->
</servlet>
]]></source>

    <p>
    The important thing is for the resource bundle to be found on the
    class path for your application. 
    Another approach is to store the <code>MyResources.properties</code> 
    file in your application's <code>classes</code> folder. 
    You can then simply specify "myResources" as the application value. 
    Just be careful it is not deleted if your build script deletes 
    classes as part of a "clean" target.
    </p>

    <p>
    If it does, here is an Ant task to run when compiling your application
    that copies the contents of a <code>src/conf</code>
    directory to the <code>classes</code> directory:
    </p>

<source><![CDATA[
<!-- Copy any configuration files -->
<copy todir="classes">
<fileset dir="src/conf"/>
</copy>
]]></source>

</subsection>

<subsection name="3.3 Forms and FormBean Interactions">

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> While the examples given here use JSP and custom tags,
    the ActionForm beans and the other Struts controller components are
    View neutral. 
    Struts can be used with Velocity Templates, XSL, and any other 
    presentation technology that can be rendered via a Java servlet. 
</p>

    <p>
    At one time or another, most web developers have built forms using
    the standard capabilities of HTML, such as the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
    tag.  
    Users have come to expect interactive applications to have certain
    behaviors, and one of these expectations relates to error handling -- if
    the user makes an error, the application should allow them to fix just 
    what needs to be changed -- without having to re-enter any of the rest 
    of the information on the current page or form.
    </p>

    <p>
    Fulfilling this expectation is tedious and cumbersome when coding with
    standard HTML and JSP pages.  
    For example, an input element for a <code>username</code> field might 
    look like this (in JSP):
    </p>
   
<source><![CDATA[
<input type="text" name="username"
value="<%= loginBean.getUsername() >"/>
]]></source>

    <p>
    which is difficult to type correctly, confuses HTML developers who are
    not knowledgeable about programming concepts, and can cause problems with
    HTML editors.  
    Instead, Struts provides a comprehensive facility for building forms, 
    based on the Custom Tag Library facility of JSP 1.1.
    The case above would be rendered like this using Struts:
    </p>

<source><![CDATA[
<html:text property="username"/>;
]]></source>

    <p>
    with no need to explicitly refer to the JavaBean from which the initial
    value is retrieved.  That is handled automatically by the JSP tag, using
    facilities provided by the framework.
    </p>

    <p>
    HTML forms are sometimes used to upload other files. 
    Most browsers support this through a &lt;input type="file"&gt; element, 
    that generates a file browse button, but it's up to the developer to 
    handle the incoming files. 
    Struts handles these "multipart" forms in a way identical to building 
    normal forms. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For an example of using Struts to create a simple login form, 
    see the "<a href="../faqs/actionForm.html">
    Buiding an ActionForm Howto</a>".
    </p>

</subsection>


<subsection name="3.3.1 Indexed and Mapped Properties">

    <p>
    Property references in JSP pages using the Struts framework can reference
    Java Bean properties as described in the JavaBeans specification. 
    Most of these references refer to "scalar" bean properties, referring to 
    primitive or single Object properties.  
    However, Struts, along with the Jakarta Commons Beanutils library, allow 
    you to use property references which refer to individual items in an array, 
    collection, or map, which are represented by bean methods using 
    well-defined naming and signature schemes.
    </p>

<p>
 Documentation on the Beanutils package can be found at 
 <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/api/index.html">
 http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/api/index.html</a>.
 More information about using indexed and mapped properties in Struts can
 be found in the FAQ describing <a
 href="../faqs/indexedprops.html"><em>Indexed Properties, Mapped Properties,
 and Indexed Tags</em></a>.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.3.2 Input Field Types Supported">

    <p>
    Struts defines HTML tags for all of the following types of input fields,
    with hyperlinks to the corresponding reference information.
    </p>

    <ul>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#checkbox">checkboxes</a>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#hidden">hidden</a> fields
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#password">password</a> input fields
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#radio">radio</a> buttons
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#reset">reset</a> buttons
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#select">select</a> lists with embedded 
        option or options items
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#option">option</a>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#options">options</a>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#submit">submit</a> buttons
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#text">text</a> input fields
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <a href="struts-html.html#textarea">textareas</a>
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>
    In every
    case, a field tag must be nested within a <code>form</code> tag, so that
    the field knows what bean to use for initializing displayed values.
    </p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="3.3.3 Other Useful Presentation Tags">

    <p>
    There are several tags useful for creating presentations, consult the 
    documentation on each specific tag library, along with the Tag Developers 
    Guides, for more information:
    </p>

    <ul>

    <li>
    [logic] <a href="struts-logic.html#iterate">iterate</a> repeats its 
    tag body once for each element of a specified collection (which can be an 
    Enumeration, a Hashtable, a Vector, or an array of objects).
    </li>
    
    <li>
    [logic] <a href="struts-logic.html#present">present</a> depending on 
    which  attribute is specified, this tag checks the current request, and 
    evaluates the nested body content of this tag only if the specified value 
    is present. 
    Only one of the attributes may be used in one occurrence of this tag, 
    unless you use the property attribute, in which case the name attribute 
    is also required. 
    The attributes include cookie, header, name, parameter, property, role, 
    scope, and user.
    </li>

    <li>
    [logic] <a href="struts-logic.html#notPresent">notPresent</a> the 
    companion tag to present, notPresent provides the same functionality when 
    the specified attribute is not present.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    [html] <a href="struts-html.html#link">link</a> generates a HTML 
    &lt;a&gt; element as an anchor definition or a hyperlink to the specified 
    URL, and automatically applies URL encoding to maintain session state in 
    the absence of cookie support.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    [html] <a href="struts-html.html#img">img</a> generates a HTML 
    &lt;img&gt; element with the ability to dynamically modify the URLs 
    specified by the "src" and "lowsrc" attributes in the same manner that 
    &lt;html:link> can.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    [bean] <a href="struts-bean.html#parameter">parameter</a> 
    retrieves the value of the specified request parameter, and defines the 
    result as a page scope attribute of type String or String[].
    </li>
    
    </ul>

</subsection>

<subsection name="3.3.4 Automatic Form Validation">

    <p>
    In addition to the form and bean interactions described above, Struts
    offers an additional facility to validate the input fields it has received.
    To utilize this feature, override the following method in your ActionForm
    class:
    </p>

<source><![CDATA[
validate(ActionMapping mapping,
HttpServletRequest request);
]]></source>

    <p>
    The <code>validate</code> method is called by the controller servlet after
    the  bean properties have been populated, but before the corresponding 
    action class's <code>execute</code> method is invoked. 
    The <code>validate</code> method has the following options:
    </p>

    <ul>

        <li>
        Perform the appropriate validations and find no problems -- Return
        either <code>null</code> or a zero-length ActionErrors instance, 
        and the controller servlet will proceed to call the 
        <code>perform</code> method of the appropriate <code>Action</code> class.
        </li>

        <li>
        Perform the appropriate validations and find problems -- Return an 
        ActionErrors instance containing <code>ActionMessage</code>'s, which 
        are classes that contain the error message keys (into the 
        application's <code>MessageResources</code> bundle) that should be 
        displayed. 
        The controller servlet will store this array as a request attribute 
        suitable for use by the <code>&lt;html:errors&gt;</code> tag, and 
        will forward control back to the input form (identified by the 
        <code>input</code> property for this <code>ActionMapping</code>).
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>
    As mentioned earlier, this feature is entirely optional.  
    The default implementation of the <code>validate</code> method returns 
    <code>null</code>, and the controller servlet will assume that any 
    required validation is done by the action class.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    One common approach is to perform simple, prima facia validations using 
    the ActionForm <code>validate</code> method, and then handle the 
    "business logic" validation from the Action.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Struts Validator, covered in the next section, may be used to easily 
    validate ActionForms.
    </p>
    
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.3.5 The Struts Validator">

    <p>
    Configuring the Validator to perform form validation is easy.
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>
    The ActionForm bean must extend ValidatorForm
    </li>
    <li>
    The form's JSP must include the 
    <a href="struts-html.html">&lt;html:javascript&gt;</a> tag for client 
    side validation.
    </li>
    <li>
    You must define the validation rules in an xml file like this:
    
<source><![CDATA[
<form-validation>
<formset>             
<form name="logonForm">
  <field property="username" depends="required">
    <msg name="required" key="error.username"/>
  </field>    
</form>        
</formset>   
</form-validation>
]]></source>
The msg element points to the message resource key to use when generating the error message.
</li>
<li>Lastly, you must enable the ValidatorPlugin in the struts-config.xml file like this:
<source><![CDATA[
<plug-in className="org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorPlugIn">
<set-property 
property="pathnames" 
value="/WEB-INF/validator-rules.xml, 
    /WEB-INF/validation.xml"/>
</plug-in>
]]></source>

        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> If your required form property is one of the Java object representations of 
    primitive types (ie. java.lang.Integer), you must set the ActionServlet's convertNull init.
    parameter to true.  Failing to do this will result in the required validation not being performed
    on that field because it will default to 0.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For more about the Struts Validator, see the 
    <a href="./dev_validator.html">Developers Guide</a>.
    </p>
    
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.4 Other Presentation Techniques">

    <p>
    Although the look and feel of your application can be completely
    constructed based on the standard capabilities of JSP and the Struts
    custom tag library, you should consider employing other techniques that
    will improve component reuse, reduce maintenance efforts, and/or reduce
    errors.  
    Several options are discussed in the following sections.
    </p>
  
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.4.1 Application-Specific Custom Tags">

    <p>
    Beyond using the custom tags provided by the Struts library, it is easy
    to create tags that are specific to the application you are building, to
    assist in creating the user interface.  The MailReader example application included with
    Struts illustrates this principle by creating the following tags unique to
    the implementation of this application:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>checkLogon</strong> - Checks for the existence of a particular session
    object, and forwards control to the logon page if it is missing.  This is
    used to catch cases where a user has bookmarked a page in the middle of
    your application and tries to bypass logging on, or if the user's session
    has been timed out. (Note that there are better ways to authenticate users; the
    checkLogon tag is simply meant to demonstrate writing your own custom tags.) </li>
    <li><strong>linkSubscription</strong> - Generates a hyperlink to a details page
    for a Subscription, which passes the required primary key values as
    request attributes.  This is used when listing the subscriptions associated
    with a user, and providing links to edit or delete them.</li>
    <li><strong>linkUser</strong> - Generates a hyperlink to a details page
    for a User, which passes the required primary key values as
    request attributes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The source code for these tags is in the <code>src/example</code> directory,
    in package <code>org.apache.struts.example</code>, along with the other Java
    classes that are used in this application.
    </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="3.4.2 Page Composition With Includes">

    <p>
    Creating the entire presentation of a page in one JSP file (with custom
    tags and beans to access the required dynamic data) is a very common 
    design approach, and was employed in the example application included 
    with Struts.
    However, many applications require the display of multiple logically 
    distinct portions of your application together on a single page.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, a portal application might have some or all of the following
    functional capabilities available on the portal's "home" page:
    </p>

    <ul>
    
        <li>
        Access to a search engine for this portal.
        </li>

        <li>
        One or more "news feed" displays, with the topics of interest 
        customizedfrom the user's registration profile.
        </li>

        <li>
        Access to discussion topics related to this portal.
        </li>

        <li>
        A "mail waiting" indicator if your portal provides free email
        accounts.
        </li>
    
    </ul>

    <p>
    The development of the various segments of this site is easier if you
    can divide up the work, and assign different developers to the different
    segments.  
    Then, you can use the <em>include</em> capability of JavaServer Pages
    technology to combine the results into a single result page, or use the 
    include tag provided with Struts.  
    There are three types of <em>include</em> available, depending on when you w
    ant the combination of output to occur:
    </p>

    <ul>
    
        <li>
        An <code>&lt;%@ include file="xxxxx" %&gt;</code> directive can 
        include a file that contains Java code or JSP tags. 
        The code in the included file can even reference variables declared 
        earlier in the outer jsp page. 
        The code is inlined into the other JavaServer Page before it is 
        compiled so it can definitely contain more than just HTML.
        </li>

        <li>
        The include <em>action</em> (<code>&lt;jsp:include page="xxxxx"
        flush="true" /&gt;</code>) is processed at request time, and is 
        handled transparently by the server.  
        Among other things, that means you can conditionally perform the 
        include by nesting it within a tag like 
        <a href="struts-logic.html#equal">equal</a> by using it's
        parameter attribute.
        </li>

        <li>
        The <a href="struts-bean.html#include">bean:include</a> 
        tag takes either a an argument "forward" representing a logical name 
        mapped to the jsp to include, or the "id" argument, which represents a 
        page context String variable to print out to the jsp page.
        </li>

<subsection name="3.4.3 Page Composition With Tiles">

    <p>
    Tiles is a powerful templating library that allows you to construct views 
    by combining various "tiles".  
    Here's a quick setup guide:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
        Create a /layout/layout.jsp file that contains your app's common look and 
        feel:
    
<source><![CDATA[
<html>
<body>
<tiles:insert attribute="body"/>
</body>
</html>
]]></source>
        </li>
        
        <li>
    Create your /index.jsp homepage file:
    
<source><![CDATA[
<h1>This is my homepage</h1>
]]></source>

        </li>

        <li>
        Create a /WEB-INF/tiles-defs.xml file that looks like this:

<source><![CDATA[
<tiles-definitions>
<definition 
    name="layout" 
    path="/layout/layout.jsp">
    <put name="body" value=""/>
</definition>
<definition name="homepage" extends="layout">
    <put 
        name="body" 
        value="/index.jsp"/>
</definition>
<tiles-definitions>
]]></source>
        </li>

        <li>
        Setup the TilesPlugin in the struts-config.xml file:
        
<source><![CDATA[
<plug-in 
    className="org.apache.struts.tiles.TilesPlugin">
    <set-property 
        property="definitions-config" 
        value="/WEB-INF/tiles-defs.xml"/>
</plug-in>
]]></source>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Setup an action mapping in struts-config.xml to point to your 
        homepage tile:

<source><![CDATA[
<action 
path="/index"
type="org.apache.struts.actions.ForwardAction"
parameter="homepage"/>
]]></source>
        </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        The TilesPlugin configures a special RequestProcessor that determines 
        if the requested view is a tile and processes it accordingly.  
        Note that we made the homepage tile extend our root layout tile and 
        changed the body attribute.  
        Tiles inserts the file named in the body attribute into the main 
        layout.
        </p>

        <p>
        See the tiles-documentation webapp for in-depth examples.

  <subsection name="3.4.4 Image Rendering Components">

        <p>
        Some applications require dynamically generated images, like the 
        price charts on a stock reporting site.  
        Two different approaches are commonly  used to meet these 
        requirements:
        </p>

    <ul>
  
        <li>
        Render a hyperlink with a URL that executes a servlet request.  
        The servlet will use a graphics library to render the graphical image,
        set the content type appropriately (such as to 
        <code>image/gif</code>), and send back the bytes of that image to the 
        browser, which will display them just as if it had received a static 
        file.
        </li>

        <li>
        Render the HTML code necessary to download a Java applet that 
        creates the required graph.  
        You can configure the graph by setting appropriate initialization 
        parameters for the applet in the rendered code, or you can have the 
        applet make its own connection to the server to receive
        these parameters.
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="3.4.5 Rendering Text">

    <p>
    Some applications require dynamically generated text or markup,
    such as XML. 
    If a complete page is being rendered, and can be output using a 
    PrintWriter, this is very easy to do from an Action:
    </p>

<source><![CDATA[
response.setContentType("text/plain"); // or text/xml
PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();
// use writer to render text
return(null);
]]></source>

</subsection>

    <subsection name="3.4.6 The Struts-EL Tag Library">
    
    <p>
    The <strong>Struts-EL</strong> tag library is a contributed library in
    the Struts distribution.  
    It represents an integration of the Struts tag library with the JavaServer 
    Pages Standard Tag Library, or at least the "expression evaluation" 
    engine that is used by the JSTL.
    </p>

    <p>
    The base Struts tag library contains tags which rely on the evaluation
    of "rtexprvalue"s (runtime scriptlet expressions) to evaluate dynamic
    attribute values.  For instance, to print a message from a properties
    file based on a resource key, you would use the
    <code>bean:write</code> tag, perhaps like this:</p>
    <source>
    <![CDATA[<bean:message key='<%= stringvar %>'/>]]>
    </source>

    <p>
    This assumes that <code>stringvar</code> exists as a JSP scripting
    variable.  If you're using the <strong>Struts-EL</strong> library, the
    reference looks very similar, but slightly different, like this:</p>
    <source>
    <![CDATA[<bean-el:message key="${stringvar}"/>]]>
    </source>

    <p>
    If you want to know how to properly use the <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
    tag library, there are two important things you need to know:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    
        <li>
        The Struts tag library
        </li>

        <li>
        The JavaServer Pages Standard tag library
        </li>

    </ul>


    <p>
    Once you understand how to use these two, consider Struts tag
    attribute values being evaluated the same way the JSTL tag attribute
    values are.  
    Past that, there is very little else you need to know to effectively use 
    the <strong>Struts-EL</strong> tag library.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Although the <strong>Struts-EL</strong> tag library is a direct "port"
    of the tags from the Struts tag library, not all of the tags in the
    Struts tag library were implemented in the <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
    tag library.  
    This was the case if it was clear that the functionality of a particular 
    Struts tag could be entirely fulfilled by a tag in the JSTL.  
    It is assumed that developers will want to use the 
    <strong>Struts-EL</strong> tag library along with the JSTL, so it is 
    reasonable to assume that they will use tags from the JSTL if they
    fill their needs.
