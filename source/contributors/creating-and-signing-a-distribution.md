## How to prepare a normal release ?

- create a Version Notes page and start adding important changes to it
- create a filter in JIRA with `Fix Version` pointing to the release version you want to prepare
- review JIRA issues and re-organise them, move the `Fix Version` to the next release or `Future`, mark what should be 
  solved in the release you're working on

## How to prepare a fast track release ?

- keep all the information confidential as possible, communicate throughout security@struts.a.o group
- restrict access to all the related pages created in Confluence to struts-committers group only, they can be made 
  public available after a fix or workaround has been released
