## How do ASF Committers obtain an IDEA license?

Please read the following blog post about JetBrains support for Apache - [JetBrains Supports the Apache Software Foundation](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2019/05/30/jetbrains-supports-the-apache-software-foundation/) 

### How do I get a apache.org email account to get the IDEA License?

The Apache Software Foundation is an organization, and not a free web host. An ASF account is earned by making sustained 
and welcome contributions to a project. For more, see:

- [http://apache.org/foundation/faq.html#joining](http://apache.org/foundation/faq.html#joining)
- [http://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy](http://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy)
- [http://struts.apache.org/helping.html](http://struts.apache.org/helping.html)

The reason JetBrains (among others) give committers licenses is because we have earned them by helping to create open 
source products, many of which JetBrains uses internally.
