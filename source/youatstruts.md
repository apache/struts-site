# You at Apache Struts

We are happy you are considering to contribute to Apache Struts and
we are definitely looking forward to your work.

We all are a happy group of volunteers and much often work on Struts
in our free time. We are not getting any money for our work from the
Apache Software Foundation (nor does any other project receive money)
and most of us are not paid by a company for working on Struts.

Still we are happy to contribute, meet up from time to time and
provide user support. That's because we have formed a community
where we know, trust, and learn from each other.

Considering that we are a grown set of people, you must understand
that you need to grow into the project as well if you want to join.
While we are happy to accept your patches if they fit or discuss
technical changes on them with you, we cannot provide SCM access
on request. But if we start to believe you have grown into the project
and would make a great addition to our committer community we'll
held a private discussion and eventually invite you to join officially.

You can read more about this on the page ["How the ASF works"](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html).

Now as you have understood that you don't need to ask for anything to start,
you can simply start. It is always a good idea to first subscribe to the
[Developers Mailinglist](dev-mail.html). We are discussing everything
around Struts in public (except a few things, like discussions on persons).
With reading the developers list you'll get a good idea what we are planning
and maybe even how you can help.

Another way is to simply look through the [Issue Tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW)
and work on a patch. It's recommended to first try to understand and then discuss
what you plan on the mailing list. This way we will find out if we are on
the same page and of course will learn about you.

Please note, not only code contributions are welcome. We also invite people
to join us because they have written extraordinary examples, documentation
or help a lot on the user mailing lists. For us, "Community is over Code".
And a good community does not reduce itself to people who write code.

Here is another comment that was sent to the Jakarta Turbine Mailing
List about the open source process and the contrast between how an
open source product and a proprietary product improve through the user
community: [Understanding Opensource](http://jakarta.apache.org/site/understandingopensource.html).

While written for ASF developers, the Rules for Revolutionaries provides insight into how
the collaborative process works, and how our process differs from working on a hierarchical
team: [Rules for Revolutionaries](http://incubator.apache.org/learn/rules-for-revolutionaries.html)

Feel free to ping us on the [Developers Mailinglist](dev-mail.html) if you have
any questions. Also make sure you read the [FAQ](helping.html) which provides
more information how you can help us.
