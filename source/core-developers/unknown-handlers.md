# Unknown Handlers

Unknown Handler stacks are available from Struts 2.1 on.

## Unknown Handlers

Unknown Handlers are classes that implement the `com.opensymphony.xwork2.UnknownHandler` interface, and are called 
by the framework, when an unknown action, result, or method are executed. To define an unknown handler, create a class 
implementing the mentioned interface, and add a bean definition to your struts.xml:

```xml
<bean type="com.opensymphony.xwork2.UnknownHandler" name="handler" class="myclasses.SomeUnknownHandler"/>
```

## Stacking Unknown Handlers

Multiple unknown handlers can be defined, using the _unknown-handler-stack_  tag:

```xml
<bean type="com.opensymphony.xwork2.UnknownHandler" name="handler1" class="com.opensymphony.xwork2.config.providers.SomeUnknownHandler"/>
<bean type="com.opensymphony.xwork2.UnknownHandler" name="handler2" class="com.opensymphony.xwork2.config.providers.SomeUnknownHandler"/>

<unknown-handler-stack>
   <unknown-handler-ref name="handler1" />
   <unknown-handler-ref name="handler2" />
</unknown-handler-stack>
```

When multiple unknown handlers are stacked like above, they will be called in the specified order, in the same cases 
when a single unknown handler would be called (when an unknown action, result, or method are executed), until one of them 
handles the requested action. 

## Unknown Handlers Manager

The default class that handles unknown handler stacks is `com.opensymphony.xwork2.DefaultUnknownHandlerManager`, 
a custom implementation of this class can be provided by implementing the interface `com.opensymphony.xwork2.UnknownHandlerManager`
and setting the property `struts.unknownHandlerManager`.
