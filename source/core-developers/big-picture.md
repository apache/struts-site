# Big Picture

The diagram describes the framework's architecture.

![Struts2-Architecture.png](attachments/Struts2-Architecture.png)

In the diagram, an initial request goes to the Servlet container (such as Jetty or Resin) which is passed through 
a standard filter chain. The chain includes the (optional) **ActionContextCleanUp** filter, which is useful when 
integrating technologies such as _SiteMesh Plugin_ . Next, the required **FilterDispatcher** is called, which in turn 
consults the [ActionMapper](action-mapper) to determine if the request should invoke an action.

If the ActionMapper determines that an Action should be invoked, the FilterDispatcher delegates control 
to the **ActionProxy**.  The ActionProxy consults the framework [Configuration Files](configuration-files) manager 
(initialized from the [struts.xml](struts-xml) file). Next, the ActionProxy creates an **ActionInvocation**, which is 
responsible for the command pattern implementation. This includes invoking any **Interceptors** (the [before](before-annotation) 
clause) in advance of invoking the **Action** itself.

Once the Action returns, the ActionInvocation is responsible for looking up the proper **result** associated 
with the **Action result code** mapped in `struts.xml`.

The result is then executed, which often (but not always, as is the case for [Action Chaining](action-chaining)) 
involves a template written in [JSP](../tag-developers/jsp) or [FreeMarker](../tag-developers/freemarker) to be rendered. 
While rendering, the templates can use the [Struts Tags](../tag-developers/struts-tags) provided by the framework. 
Some of those components will work with the ActionMapper to render proper URLs for additional requests.


> All objects in this architecture (Actions, [Results](result-types), [Interceptors](interceptors), and so forth) are 
> created by an [ObjectFactory](object-factory). This ObjectFactory is pluggable. We can provide our own ObjectFactory 
> for any reason that requires knowing when objects in the framework are created. A popular ObjectFactory implementation 
> uses Spring as provided by the [Spring Plugin](../plugins/).

Interceptors are executed again (in reverse order, calling the [after](after-annotation) clause). Finally, the response 
returns through the filters configured in the web.xml.
