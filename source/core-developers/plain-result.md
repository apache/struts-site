# Plain Result

## Description

You create this result programmatically in an action and return it as a result of the action. No result definition
is needed in `struts.xml`. See the examples below how to use it. Please notice that the method result type is `PlainResult`
instead of `String`. Please explore the API for more methods - if any is missing you can either extends the interface
or report it in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/WW/).

> NOTE: This result is available since Struts 2.6 and it requires Java 8 

## Parameters

    }

    public PlainResult html() {
        return response -> response.write("<b>test</b>").withContentTypeTextHtml();
    }

}
```
