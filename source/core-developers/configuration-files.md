# Configuration Files

From a Struts developer point of view, the one required configuration file used by the framework is `web.xml`.  
From here, you have full control over how Struts configures both itself and your application.  By default, Struts will 
load a set of internal configuration files to configure itself, then another set to configure your application, however 
it is possible to build an entire Struts application without writing a single configuration file other than `web.xml`.

The table lists the files that you can use to configure the framework for your application. Some configuration files 
can be reloaded dynamically. Dynamic reloading makes interactive development possible. 
See [Reloading configuration](reloading-configuration) for more.

## Static Content

Common static content that is needed by the framework (JavaScript and CSS files, etc.) is served automatically by 
the FilterDispatcher filter.  Any request starting with `/struts/` denotes that static content is required, and then 
mapping the value after `/struts/` to common packages in the framework and, optionally in the application's class path.

By default, the following packages are searched:

- `org.apache.struts2.static`
- `template`

Additional packages can be specified by providing a comma separated list to the configuration parameter named "packages" 
(configured in `web.xml` for the FilterDispatcher filter). When specifying additional static content, you should 
be careful not to expose sensitive configuration information (such as the password to a database).
