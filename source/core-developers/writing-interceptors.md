# Writing Interceptors

See the [Interceptors](interceptors) page for an overview of how interceptors work.

## Interceptor interface

Interceptors must implement the `com.opensymphony.xwork2.interceptor.Interceptor` interface.

**Interceptor.java**

```java
public interface Interceptor extends Serializable {

    void destroy();

    void init();

    String intercept(ActionInvocation invocation) throws Exception;
}
```

The `init` method is called the after interceptor is instantiated and before calling `intercept`. This is the place 
to allocate any resources used by the interceptor.

The `intercept` method is where the interceptor code is written. Just like an action method, `intercept` returns 
a result used by Struts to forward the request to another web resource. Calling `invoke` on the parameter of type 
`ActionInvocation` will execute the action (if this is the last interceptor on the stack) or another interceptor.

> Keep in mind that `invoke` will return **after** the result has been called (eg. after you JSP has been rendered), 
> making it perfect for things like open-session-in-view patterns. If you want to do something before the result gets 
> called, you should implement a `PreResultListener`.

Overwrite `destroy` to release resources on application shutdown.

## Thread Safety

**Interceptors must be thread-safe!**

> A Struts 2 Action instance is created for every request and do not need to be thread-safe. Conversely, Interceptors 
> are shared between requests and must be [thread-safe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-safety). 


## AbstractInterceptor

The AbstractInterceptor class provides an empty implementation of `init` and `destroy`, and can be used if these 
methods are not going to be implemented.

## Mapping

Interceptors are declared using the `<interceptor/>` element, nested inside the `<interceptors/>` element. 
Example from `struts-default.xml`:

```xml
<struts>
   ...

   <package name="struts-default">
      <interceptors>
         <interceptor name="alias" class="com.opensymphony.xwork2.interceptor.AliasInterceptor"/>
         <interceptor name="autowiring" class="com.opensymphony.xwork2.spring.interceptor.ActionAutowiringInterceptor"/>
         ...
      </interceptors>
   </package>

   ...
</struts>
```

### Example

Assuming there is an action of type "MyAction", with a setDate(Date) method, this simple interceptor will set the date 
of the action to the current date:

**Interceptor Example**

```java
import com.opensymphony.xwork2.ActionInvocation;
import com.opensymphony.xwork2.interceptor.AbstractInterceptor;

public class SimpleInterceptor extends AbstractInterceptor {

    public String intercept(ActionInvocation invocation) throws Exception {
       MyAction action = (MyAction)invocation.getAction();
       action.setDate(new Date());
       return invocation.invoke();
    }
}
```
