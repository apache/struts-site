The example code for this tutorial, **annotations**, is available for checkout at [struts-examples](https://github.com/apache/struts-examples)

## Introduction

In our previous tutorials we've been using an XML file (`struts.xml`) to configure our applications. The XML file wires 
up the action names (register), with ActionSupport classes (`RegisterAction.java`), and with the result to render back 
to the browser (`register.jsp`). Struts provides an alternative to using XML to configure your application by using 
standard naming conventions and annotations for your action names, `ActionSupport` classes, and results.

This tutorial assumes you understand how to apply annotations to Java classes and methods. If you're not familiar with 
annotations, consult the [Java online tutorial](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/annotations).

The [Struts user mailing list](http://struts.apache.org/mail) is an excellent place to get help. If you are having 
a problem getting the tutorial example applications to work search the Struts mailing list. If you don't find an answer 
to your problem, post a question on the mailing list.

## Struts Convention Plugin

Struts enables the use of standard naming conventions and annotations when you include the Convention plugin in your 
application's class path. If you're using Maven you'll need to add a dependency:

**Convention Plugin Dependency**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.struts</groupId>
    <artifactId>struts2-convention-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>X.X.X.X</version>
</dependency>
```

If you're using Ant then copy the struts2-convention-plugin jar file from the Struts download to your `WEB-INF/lib` folder.

The convention plugin provide several different ways you can configure your Struts application without using XML. 
Consult the [Convention Plugin](../plugins/convention) documentation for complete details. This tutorial only examines 
one simple way of following the conventions provided by the Convention plugin.

When you run the example application you'll see on the `index.jsp` page a link to Get your hello. This URL for the link 
is `hello.action`. When you click on this link, the execute method of class `HelloAction.java` (which is a Struts `ActionSupport` class) 
is run. The view page rendered back to the browser after the execute method returns success is `hello-success.jsp`.

None of the above is wired up using XML but rather happens because the application follows the standard naming conventions 
expected by the Convention plugin. The first convention is that the ActionSupport class, `HelloAction.java`, is in package 
`org.apache.struts.struts2annotations.action`. One of the Convention plugin's defaults is to look for `ActionSupport`
classes that are in package structure that ends in action. The next convention the application follows is that `HelloAction.java`
extends the ActionSupport class and defines an execute method. The link is hello.action. When the Struts filter sees 
a request for hello.action it will map that request to the HelloAction class's execute method due to the Convention
plugin being used.

So a link of hello.action causes the execute method of class HelloAction to be run. That method returns `success`. 
Because the application is using the Convention plugin, Struts will render back to the browser a view page named 
`hello-success.jsp` that is located in WEB-INF/content (by default the Convention plugin expects all view pages to be 
in this location). If the execute method returns "input" or "error" then the view page rendered would have been 
`hello-input.jsp` or `hello-error.jsp`.

## Struts Configuration Plugin

In a [previous tutorial](debugging-struts) we reviewed how to use the Struts Configuration plugin to view the details 
of how Struts has configured your application. When using the Convention plugin, it's very handy to also use 
the Configuration plugin during development. On the example application's home page is a link to the application's configuration. 
Click on that link and then the hello link on the left menu (under Actions in default). You'll see the configuration 
for the hello action including it's Action class, result, and view page.

## Annotations

If you want to go beyond the simple naming conventions provided by the Convention plugin, you can use the Struts 
annotations also provided by the plugin. For example, a common work-flow for a Struts application is to first execute 
the ActionSupport class's input method to setup form field default values and then to run the execute method of the same 
ActionSupport class when the form is submitted (to validate and save the user's input).

The link to Register for the drawing on the example application's home page follows this work flow. The link value 
is `register-input.action`. If you examine the RegisterAction.java class you'll find the input method with an Action annotation.

**Action Annotation**

```java
@Action("register-input")
public String input() throws Exception {
    logger.info("In input method of class Register");

    return INPUT;
}
```

The Action annotation tells Struts to execute the annotated method when the action link value equals the Action 
annotation's value (`register-input`). So a link of `register-input.action` will call the input method of class `RegisterAction`. 
On the example application's home page is a link to Register for the drawing with a URL of `register-input.action`.

The input method above returns "input". By the standards of the Convention plugin, the view page rendered will be 
`register-input.jsp` (from `WEB-INF/content`). On that view page is a Struts form tag with an action attribute value 
of register. When submitting the form, the execute method of class RegisterAction will be run. Since the execute method 
returns success, the view page rendered is `register-success.jsp`.

## Struts Configuration Values

In previous examples, we included in `struts.xml` values for some of the Struts configuration parameters.

**struts.xml parameter configuration**

```xml
<constant name="struts.devMode" value="true" />
```

When we don't use a struts.xml file, we can set the value of these Struts parameters by using filter parameters in `web.xml`:

**Struts Parameter Configuration web.xml**

```xml
<filter>
    <filter-name>struts2</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.filter.StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>struts.devMode</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </init-param>
</filter>
```

## Summary

We've just scratched the surface of what the Struts convention plugin provides to reduce or eliminate the need to use 
an XML file to configure your Struts application. The Struts Convention plugin provides ways to map multiple actions 
to the same method, map results to different view pages, map errors to view pages, and much more. Be sure to read through 
the [Convention Plugin](../plugins/convention/) documentation for alternative ways to configure your Struts application.
