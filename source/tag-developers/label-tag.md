Please make sure you have read the [Tag Syntax](tag-syntax) document and understand how tag attribute syntax works.

## Description

as the rest of your UI controls.

## Attributes

## Examples

```jsp
<s:label key="userName" />
```

In this example, a label is rendered. The label is retrieved from a ResourceBundle via the key attribute giving 
you an output of 'User Name: Ford.Prefect'. Assuming that i18n message userName corresponds to _User Name_ 
and the action's `getUserName()` method returns _Ford.Prefect_.
