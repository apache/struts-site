# Apache Struts Website

## Project Overview

This project contains the source code for the official Apache Struts website (https://struts.apache.org/). It is a static website generated by Jekyll. The site's content is written in Markdown and HTML. The project uses Maven to manage the build process, including fetching and converting documentation from Confluence.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Jekyll:** A static site generator written in Ruby.
*   **Maven:** A build automation tool used to manage the project's build lifecycle.
*   **Java:** Used for the custom tools that fetch and convert documentation from Confluence.
*   **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** The core technologies used for the website's frontend.
*   **Markdown (kramdown):** Used for writing the content of the website.

**Architecture:**

The website is structured as a typical Jekyll project. The main configuration is in `_config.yml`. The source files are in the `source` directory. The website's layout and includes are in the `_layouts` and `_includes` directories, respectively. The documentation is partially sourced from Confluence and converted to Markdown using custom Java tools managed by Maven.

## Building and Running

To build and run the website locally, you can use either Bundler and Jekyll directly or Docker.

**Using Bundler and Jekyll:**

1.  Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
2.  Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3.  Run the Jekyll server: `bundle exec jekyll serve -w --trace --host 0.0.0.0`

The website will be available at http://localhost:4000.

**Using Docker:**

There are shell scripts available to run the website in a Docker container:

*   `./docker-run.sh` (for Bash/Sh)
*   `./docker-run.fish` (for Fish shell)

These scripts will build the Docker image and run the Jekyll server. The website will be available at http://localhost:4000.

## Development Conventions

*   **Content:** Content is written in Markdown (`.md`) or HTML (`.html`) files in the `source` directory.
*   **Styling:** The website uses Bootstrap for styling. Custom styles are in the `source/css` directory.
*   **Documentation:** The documentation is a mix of Markdown files and content imported from the Struts Confluence wiki. The import process is managed by Maven profiles.
*   **Updating the Website:** The `README.md` file contains instructions on how to update the live website.
