            <strong>January 2008 -- RESTing</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
Work on Struts 2 continues apace. During this last quarter, we released
Struts 2.0.11 as GA, and produced a first test build of the Struts 2.1
code line. Struts 1 is garnering less attention these days, but there is
still a rivulet of bug fixes and other patches, albeit without any releases
this quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
At ApacheCon in Atlanta, our own Don Brown presented an excellent session
entitled "Go Light with Apache Struts 2 and REST", fitting in nicely with
a number of other REST-related sessions at the conference. The combined
Roller / Struts 2 BOF had fewer attendees than we might have hoped for, but
resulted in some productive discussion. Disappointingly, the Struts-related
tutorials were canceled due to insufficient sign-ups.
          </p>
          <p>
During this quarter, we added Musachy Barroso to the PMC, and removed Henri
Yandell at his request. No new committers joined us this quarter.

Should voting +1 on a release imply that the voter intends to help support
the release? - [14 Jan 2008] General feeling is that the PMC is acting as a
quality control group, and a binding vote indicates that a member has
reviewed the distribution, and, ideally, has tested or deployed the software
in their own environment.

<strong>October 2007 -- Planet Struts</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
There has been a lot of activity over the last quarter, especially on
Struts 2. We released Struts 2.0.9 as GA, which includes an important
security fix, and released Struts 1.3.9 as Beta. Our registry of Struts 2
plugins continues to grow, with 30 distinct plugins now registered, many
written by developers outside the project. The number of authors
contributing to our official documentation wiki also continues to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
On the infrastructure side, the Struts security alias, mentioned in last
quarter's report, has now been set up, and Planet Struts was the first "PMC
Planet" to be created, thanks to Sam Ruby and Ted Husted. Prompted by
infrastructure@, we handed back 1.6GB of disk space on people.a.o that we
didn't actually need.
          </p>
          <p>
At ApacheCon US 2007 in Atlanta next month, two tutorials and one session
will focus on Struts 2, and we expect at least six Struts committers to be
in attendance. A session on Struts 2 will also be presented at OS Summit
Asia 2007.
          </p>
          <p>
During this quarter, we have added three new committers (Matt Raible, Dave
Newton, and Brian Pontarelli) and two new PMC members (Henri Yandell and
Antonio Petrelli).
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>July 2007 -- security@struts</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
Things have been running smoothly this last quarter, with little of
note for the board at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
We have had one GA release, of Struts 2.0.8, and a test build of
Struts 1.3.9 is up for a quality vote at this time. Both Struts
2.1 and Struts 1.4 are under active development.
          </p>
          <p>
Prompted by a user trying to report a security vulnerability in
Struts, we have requested a security@s.a.o alias, which we hope will
be set up shortly. (We believe the reported vulnerability had already
been resolved.)
          </p>
          <p>
No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>March 2007 -- Bamboo online</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
This quarter, we made up for the absence of releases in the previous
quarter, with GA releases of both Struts 1.3.8 and Struts 2.0.6. The
latter is particularly notable, since it is the first GA release of the
Struts 2 framework, thus marking an important milestone for the project.
With a GA release in the wild, we hope to see increased adoption of this
new framework, with a corresponding growth in the community.
          </p>
          <p>
Since the Apache Tiles top-level project was established by the board in
December, our Tiles colleagues have completed their move out of Struts and
into their own environment. Of course, there continues to be some overlap
in the developers and communities, and we are working with our Tiles
colleagues to ensure that Tiles integration with Struts remains strong.
          </p>
          <p>
Thanks to our friends at Atlassian, we now have a hosted Bamboo continuous
integration system, providing us with regular reports on the status of our
builds. After a spate of build breakages earlier in the quarter, this has
helped us identify issues more quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
In this last quarter, we have added Paul Benedict to our PMC, and added
four new committers, namely Philip Luppens, Tom Schneider, Musachy
Barroso, and Henri Yandell.
          </p>
          <p>
Finally, we have added some spiffy new icons to the Struts 2 home page:
http://struts.apache.org/2.x/index.html
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>January 2007 -- Top-level Tiles</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
While there have been no new releases in this last quarter, there has been
a great deal of development activity. Struts 2 has been improving by leaps
and bounds, and we are close to another 2.0.x release; Tiles has gone
through significant redesign and cleanup; and Struts 1.x is making steady
progress towards another release.
          </p>
          <p>
In addition to the activity on the code base, and after a great deal of
discussion, our Tiles subproject was approved by the board as a new top
level project, and is in the process of moving out on its own. This will
help further two goals: providing Tiles with the opportunity and
environment to prosper beyond the confines of Struts; and refocusing the
Struts team on our core frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
Subsequent to some discussion and debate elsewhere, the Struts team
reorganised our web site to clearly delineate the portions of the site
intended for end users versus developers and potential developers.
          </p>
          <p>
An XSS vulnerability was reported to the Struts PMC in December. The
problem has been addressed, and the fix will be included in the upcoming
Struts 1.3.6 release.
          </p>
          <p>
No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.

<strong>October 2006 -- Struts 2 Beta</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
Much of the focus in this quarter has been in driving Struts 2 forward,
with help from a growing number of contributors. Struts 2.0.1 was elevated
from a development build to a Beta release shortly after ApacheCon, thus
marking our first public release in the Struts 2 family. We also have a
snazzy new logo that signals the integration of Struts and WebWork into
Struts 2!
          </p>
          <p>
Activity has also increased on Tiles 2 (a.k.a. Standalone Tiles), as this
moves towards its first release, and development continues on the
Struts 1.3.x line, with the General Availability (GA) release of
Struts 1.3.5 in this quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
The Struts team made the most of ApacheCon US this year. Both a tutorial
and a session on Struts 2 were offered, as well as a Struts BOF. We also
took advantage of the opportunity to create a press release announcing our
Struts 2.0.1 development build, since this is a significant milestone,
bringing together two successful web frameworks, together with their
respective communities, into a coherent whole.
          </p>
          <p>
Consistent with the increase in activity, and with the unification of the
Struts and WebWork communities, we have added eight people to the PMC this
quarter, namely Patrick Lightbody, Jason Carreira, Laurie Harper, Alexandru
Popescu, Rene Gielen, Rainer Hermanns, Toby Jee, and Ian Roughley. We have
also added three new committers: Antonio Petrelli, Nils-Helge Garli, and
David DeWolf.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>July 2006 -- Shale graduates</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
Since our April 2006 report, our former subproject Shale has graduated to a
top-level project. Our WebWork 2 podling also graduated from the incubator and
has become the basis of Struts 2. Meanwhile, Struts 1 has released three beta
releases - 1.3.2, 1.3.3, and 1.3.4 - and a Struts 1.3.5 test build is available
and proceeding toward a release quality vote. A Struts 2.0.0 distribution is
expected next month. The new Maven builds are working well, despite the
complexity of our distributions.
          </p>
          <p>
Three new committers have joined the fold: Paul Benedict, Michael Jouravlev, and
Bob Lee. Paul and Michael are longtime members of the Struts 1 use community,
and helped us provide new features and fixes for the Struts 1.2.9 release. Bob
Lee is a longtime member of the WebWork 2 user community and helped us prepare a
short list of changes for the Struts 2.0.0 distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>April 2006 -- WebWork2 podling</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
The last quarter has seen the creation of the WebWork 2 podling and rapid progress.
Our focus has been on migrating code, resources, developers, IP, and community over
to the ASF.
          </p>
          <p>
 - Code: we have imported the code into the Incubator SVN, and have renamed packages,
   taglib prefixes, and any other eferences to the old WebWork project over to the new
   Struts Action Framework 2 project, where the final location of the code will be.
          </p>
          <p>
 - Resources: We've migrated the code to the Apache SVN, setup and migrated JIRA
   tickets to the new issues.apache.org server, and are in the process of migration
   wiki documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
 - Developers: The core WebWork 2 developers have been given accounts and access to
   the podling, voted in through the proposal. We plan to vote the remaining committers
   in one-by-one through the Struts PMC, serving as the IPMC for the podling.
          </p>
          <p>
 - IP: The OpenSymphony organization, who owns the copyright on the WebWork 2 project,
   has delivered a code grant allowing us to change the copyright.  Additionally, we've
   removed most of the LGPL source code (usually in the form of Javascript libraries)
   and have developed an optional build that compiles integration code depending on
   LGPL jars, in accordance to the draft IP policy document.
          </p>
          <p>
 - Community: The WebWork 2 developers have joined the Struts mailing lists and have
   been very active in participating with both development and user threads. They have
   been just as, if not more, active committing to the code repository as Struts
   committers, and when conflicts arise, they are very quick to come to a solution in a
   positive way. In addition, several Struts committers have joined OpenSymphony forums,
   chat rooms, and projects further strengthening the relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
We are definitely planning on exiting the Incubator this next quarter, possibly within
weeks. We see a bright future for the Struts Action project, and hope to facilitate a
new spirit of cooperation within the competitive landscape of Java web application
frameworks
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>April 2006 -- Shale and Action Builds</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
The Struts community has been a busy one this last quarter. In terms of
releases, we released Struts 1.2.9, primarily to fix a reported
vulnerability, and Shale 1.0.2 Alpha. We also made available Struts Action
1.3.1 Test Build, the first completed build in the Struts Action 1.3 line.
          </p>
          <p>
After voting to accept WebWork 2, we have made progress towards removing
external dependencies with non-compatible licenses, and migrating the code
base from OpenSymphony to Struts.
          </p>
          <p>
We have decided to move all of the Struts components to JIRA for issue
tracking, and to Maven 2 for our build system. There has been much
discussion of splitting the user mailing list into multiple lists, based
on sub-project, but no consensus has been reached.
          </p>
          <p>
On the people front, we added Gary VanMatre to the PMC, and five new
committers (Alexandru Popescu, Rene Gielen, Rainer Hermanns, Toby Jee, and
Ian Roughley) as part of bringing WebWork 2 into the fold.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>January 2006 -- WebWork Merger</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
The last quarter has been an eventful one in the Struts community. In
terms of releases, we released Struts 1.2.8, primarily to fix an XSS
vulnerability; Struts Scripting 1.0.1 is the first GA release of this
component; and Struts Shale 1.0.0 is the first Alpha release of our newest
framework.
          </p>
          <p>
In the wake of the web framework "unification" discussions mentioned in
our last board report, the Struts team and the WebWork team have agreed to
join forces. There have been numerous interactions between the teams, and
the team members, for some time now, and we are confident that the merger
will work well. The plan is for WebWork to come to the ASF, and for it to
provide the underpinnings for a Struts Action Framework 2.0. We anticipate
that the IP clearance process will begin shortly, now that WebWork 2.2 has
been released.
          </p>
          <p>
On the people front, we added Wendy Smoak as a PMC member, and Rich Feit,
Patrick Lightbody and Jason Carreira have joined us as committers. Also, a
record seven Struts committers managed to be in the same place at the same
time at ApacheCon in December, leading to some very fruitful discussions.

        <subsection name="2005 Reports to the ASF Board of Directors">
          <p>
<strong>October 2005 - "Interesting times"</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
The Struts community continues to make steady progress toward the 1.3.0
release of "Struts Classic" and the 1.0.0 release of "Struts Shale", our
offering for JavaServer Faces developers (JSR-127). We've added three new
committers: Greg Reddin, Laurie Harper and Sean Schofield. Greg has been
working on Standalone Tiles, Laurie has been working with on the Struts
Classic release, and Sean is an Apache MyFaces committer who also been
working on Struts Shale. We've moved our website and development
infrastructure to Maven as our primary build, and the initial draft of our
Mavenized website is online at struts.apache.org. Our nightly builds are
now running on our Solaris 10 zone on helios. Active development is also
taking place on our Standalone Tiles and Struts Ti efforts in the sandbox,
including a substantial contribution to Struts Ti from the Beehive PageFlow
folks.
          </p>
          <p>
Members of our community have also been invited to particpate in two Java
web framework working groups. One group, "Clarity", would like to create a
best-of-breed framework that combines the features of Spring MVC, Struts
Classic, Struts Ti, Beehive and WebWork. The "Java Web Alignment Group" has
a similar charter, but they are trying to involve a broader range of
frameworks. Both groups are still at the "hand waving" stage, and there is
nothing concrete to report. The groups are already intermixing, and we hope
the consolidation efforts will themselves consolidate. :)
          </p>
          <p>
The underlying issue is that there is not a clear migration path to JSR-127
from frameworks like Struts Classic. Since many teams have several years of
development vested in "classic" frameworks, it may be some time before the
new formal standard displaces the entrenched de facto standard. These
working groups would like to consolidate the classic frameworks so as to
clear the road toward "next generation" web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
Despite these "interesting times", the Struts community remains united and
amicable. Some of us are "scouting ahead" with Strut Shale and Struts Ti,
while others trudge along with Struts Classic, but we all share the same
path.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>July 2005 - Classic Struts</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
This has been another busy quarter in the Struts community. Progress is
being made towards a 1.3 release of Struts "Classic", and work is
continuing on Struts Shale. The Tiles component is in the process of being
transformed into a Struts-independent package.
          </p>
          <p>
On the people front, Wendy Smoak has joined us as a committer, and we are
in the process of adding Gary VanMatre. We are also in the process of
adding Hubert Rabago as a new PMC member, being in the 72 hour waiting
period at the time of writing.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>April 2005 - Subproject Refactorings</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
This has been a busy quarter in the Struts community. We have completed
the refactoring of the Subversion repository into subprojects, and added a
new master build system using Maven. Two new subprojects have joined the
fold; Struts Shale is an alternative approach to web applications based on
JSF, and Struts Flow allows complex workflows to be implemented using
JavaScript. Our first proposal for a Struts subproject written in C#,
named OverDrive, has been introduced in our sandbox area.
          </p>
          <p>
On the people front, in addition to the change of PMC chair, one new
committer, Hubert Rabago, accepted an invitation to join us, and we
welcome back David Geary from emeritus to active status.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>January 2005 - Artifact "Slice and Dice"</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
The last three months have seen renewed interest and vigor about
moving Struts forward in technology terms.  Now that we have moved
our source code repository to Subversion, we are leveraging the new
capabilities to reorganize our source code into separately deliverable
artifacts (rather than one large "wad-o-stuff"), to be managed
as subprojects which can be released on their own schedules.  This
will enable us to be more responsive to the user community's desire
for timely releases, without having to coordinate one monster release.
In addition, work is underway to rationalize the build architecture
around Maven.
          </p>
          <p>
Technically, Struts 1.x  continues to evolve in a manner that is
fundamentally backwards compatible, but which leverages new internal
techniques (such as the Chain of Responsibility design pattern) that
will make customization and specialization much easier.  At the same time,
experimental development around a fresh look at web application
architectures is also taking place in the form of "Shale", a
JSF-based framework, being proposed as an alternative to Struts 1.x.

<strong>October 2004 - Subversion Switchover</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
The Struts community has recently released Struts 1.2.4 as the latest
stable version, focused on cleaning up deprecations from previous versions,
refactoring utility classes to improve separability of the core framework
from view tier dependencies, and incorporating the latest Commons libraries
on which we are dependent.
          </p>
          <p>
We recently completed a migration of our source code repository from
CVS to Subversion, and are leveraging its capabilities to refactor the
source code into separately releaseable components.  The first such
separate release is likely to be the Struts-Faces integration library
(an adapter between Struts and JavaServer Faces).
          </p>
          <p>
The community is busy planning an evolutionary path that focuses on
fundamentally backwards compatible improvements, and a revolutionary
("Struts 2") path that will leverage the industry wide lessons in how
web application frameworks should architected in the four years
since Struts was created.  The discussions are proceeding harmoniously
and productively.
          </p>
          <p>
<strong>July 2004 - Repo Reorg</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
We have started a reorganization of our repository. The goals of the refactoring
are to better support subprojects  with their own release cycles and building
Struts with Apache Maven.
          </p>
          <p>
An initial draft of the reorganization is being done under Subversion on a
private server, with all discussions taking place on the public DEV list. We will
be ready to move the work to an Apache server soon, now that we have a
consensus in favor of Subversion and Maven.
          </p>
          <p>
We completed a draft of Apache Struts bylaws and developer guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
There was a discussion on the DEV list regarding the "bar" for Committership.
The consensus is to keep the bar set fairly high and wait until a contributor has
submitted a good number of useful patches directly to Struts.
          </p>
          <p>
Our latest stable release is still 1.1 (29 June 2003). We issued a 1.2.1 release
on 11 July 2004, which is currently catagorized as a beta. We anticipate 1.2.1
(or a 1.2.2) being promoted to GA over the next 30 days.
          </p>

<strong>April 2004 - Subproject Bootstrap</strong>
          <p>
  Two new subprojects (our first) were approved. One that utilizes BSF
  so that "Actions" can be scripted rather than expressed as Java
  code. Another is a port of Cocoon's Control Flow to
  Struts. Infrastructure details are being addressed. The initial code
  for both projects was developed by a Struts PMC member, Don Brown,
  who is filing a code grant to the ASF. Both codebases are ready for
  release testing.
          </p>
          <p>
  Niall Pemberton was elected as a Struts Committer.
