The vote will remain open for at least 72 hours, longer upon request. A vote can be amended at any time to upgrade or downgrade the quality of the release based on future experience. If an initial vote designates the build as "Beta", the release will be submitted for mirroring and announced to the user list.

As always, the act of voting carries certain obligations. A binding vote not only states an opinion, but means that the voter is agreeing to help do the work

</div></div>

<div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<pre>The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts #.#.# is available as a "[Beta | General Availability]" release. [[The Beta designation indicates that we believe the distribution needs wider testing before being upgraded to a "General Availability" release. Your input is essential.] The GA designation is our highest quality grade.]

Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to maintaining applications over time.

[This release includes one important security fix:]

All developers are strongly advised to update existing Struts 2 applications to Struts #.#.#.

Struts #.#.# is available in a full distribution, or as separate library, source, example and documentation distributions, from the releases page.
* http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts###

The release is also available from the central Maven repository under Group ID "org.apache.struts".

The #.#.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum requirement of the following specification versions:
* Java Servlet 2.4 and JavaServer Pages (JSP) 2.0
* Java 2 Standard Platform Edition (J2SE) 5

The release notes are available online at:
* http://struts.apache.org/2.x/docs/version-notes-###.html

Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts framework, please post your comments to the user list, and, if appropriate, file a tracking ticket.appropriate, file a tracking ticket:

Everyone who has tested the build is invited to vote. Votes by PMC members are considered binding. A vote passes if there are at least three binding +1s and more +1s than -1s.

This is a "fast-track" release vote. If we have a positive vote after 24 hours (at least three binding +1s and more +1s than -1s),  the release may be submitted for mirroring and announced to the usual channels.

The website download link will include the mirroring timestamp parameter [1], which limits the selection of mirrors to those that have been refreshed since the indicated time and date. (After 24 hours, we *must* remove the timestamp parameter from the website link, to avoid unnecessary server load.) In the case of a fast-track release, the email announcement will not link directly to &lt;download.cgi&gt;, but to &lt;downloads.html&gt;, so that we can control use of the timestamp parameter.
